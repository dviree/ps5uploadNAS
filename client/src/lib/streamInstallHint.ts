 * What a failed install row offers when it was a Stream & install of a file on this computer:
 * the PS5 fetches the package from this computer, so whatever the error, the two things worth
 * trying are letting the PS5 reach this computer (the firewall) and Upload & install, which
 * copies the package to the PS5 first and needs no connection back.
 *
 * - `retryViaUpload`: the row can be re-run as Upload & install (only a local file can).
 * - `hint`: say both. Not when the error already is the unreachable-stream guidance, which
 *   names the firewall itself and comes with its own network fix buttons.
