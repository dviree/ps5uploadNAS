/**
 * Upload & Install (route /send): every way something gets onto the console, on one page, top
 * to bottom.
 *
 * 0. The fake-package (FPKG) note, first: PS5 fake packages do not run on firmware later than
 *    11.60 yet, which matters before anything is sent.
 * 1. From this computer or a saved server: the drop zone is the one way in. Pick or drop
 *    anything (a package, a game folder or dump, an image, an archive, any file); the app works
 *    out what it is and offers what fits it, a package's Stream & install included. It also
 *    opens the link and on-PS5 installs below.
 * 2. From a link, or an archive of packages.
 * 3. The one queue, for this console.
 * 4. Already on the PS5: packages on a USB drive and package copies put there before.
 *
 * Upload and Install Package were two screens that both installed packages (both offered
 * Stream & install and Upload & install), so people had to know which one their file
 * belonged to. Old /upload and /install-package links land here.
