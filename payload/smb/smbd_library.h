/* The game library scan (#498): walks a share, or the console's own drives, for games and writes
 * what it found to the library cache the console page reads (include/smbd_proto.h SMBD_LIB_DIR):
 *
 *   <dir>/<source>.json   {"source","scanned","complete","stopped","items":[item...]}
 *   <dir>/icons/<source>-<stamp>-<n>.png  the covers those items name
 *
 *   item = {"kind":"pkg"|"folder"|"image","path","name","title","title_id","content_id","version",
 *           "category","type":"game"|"patch"|"dlc"|"app"|"other","platform","fw","sdk","backport","fake",
 *           "size","icon"} ("sdk" the SDK it was built with, "backport" a folder holding fakelib/; "icon" is a file name in icons/, "" when there is none; "path" is the path on
 *           the side scanned: share-relative for a share, absolute for the console)
 *
 * What counts as a game:
 *   - a .pkg whose header reads (pkg_info.c: title, ids, version, type, firmware, its icon0.png);
 *   - a folder holding sce_sys/param.json (PS5) or sce_sys/param.sfo (PS4): a folder dump (its
 *     icon is sce_sys/icon0.png; it is never walked into);
 *   - a disk image (.exfat, .ffpkg, .ffpfs, .ffpfsc): named after the file, its title id taken
 *     from the name when it carries one ("PPSA01234 Game.exfat").
 *
 * Bounded, because a share can be huge: LIB_DEPTH_MAX folders deep, LIB_ENTRIES_MAX entries looked
 * at, LIB_DIR_ENTRIES_MAX per folder, LIB_ITEMS_MAX items, LIB_TIME_MAX_S, covers up to
 * LIB_ICON_MAX each and LIB_ICON_BUDGET together. Hitting one ends the walk with "stopped" naming
 * it ("depth" only skips that folder); what was found so far is kept. Hidden entries (".x"),
 * macOS / NAS metadata folders and the helper's own data folder are skipped.
 *
 * The previous result stays in place until the new one is written whole (temp file + rename in the
 * same folder); the old scan's covers are then removed. */
