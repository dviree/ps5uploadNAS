/* The copy state machine: one file or one folder tree from a source filesystem to a destination
 * filesystem (SMB -> console, console -> SMB), with progress, cancel, conflict rules and recovery
 * from a server that drops mid-copy. Both sides are behind xfs_t, so the host test drives it with
 * an in-memory filesystem that can fail on cue (payload/tests/smbd_copy_selftest.c).
 *
 * Rules:
 * - A file is written to "<dest>.ps5u-part" in the destination's own folder and renamed over
 *   <dest> when it is complete (same folder: never a cross-device rename). A failure or a cancel
 *   removes the part file; the destination is never left half-written.
 * - An existing destination file is refused (XE_EXISTS) unless `overwrite`; an existing folder is
 *   refused at the top unless `overwrite` (then it is merged: files in it are replaced).
 * - A read or write that fails as XE_DISCONNECTED / XE_TIMEOUT / XE_IO on a side that can
 *   reconnect is retried after reconnecting (COPY_RETRIES times, waits 1 s, 2 s, 4 s), carrying on
 *   from the same offset; then the copy fails with that error.
 * - Links and other special entries are skipped. Folder trees deeper than COPY_MAX_DEPTH are refused.
 * - Buffers are bounded: one chunk of at most COPY_CHUNK_MAX, on the heap. */
