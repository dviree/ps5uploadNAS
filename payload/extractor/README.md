# ps5upload-extractor

The on-console archive extractor: Files (the console page) and the PC app's File system screen
can extract a `.zip`/`.zipx`, `.7z`, `.rar`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`/`.tgz`, `.tar.bz2`/`.tbz2`,
`.tar.xz`/`.txz`, `.tar.zst`/`.tzst`, a single `.gz`/`.bz2`/`.xz`/`.zst` file, or a volume set
(`x.7z.001`, `x.zip.001`, `x.part01.rar`, `x.rar` + `x.r00`) that sits on the PS5 into a folder
on the PS5. Nothing crosses the network, and no computer is needed.

## Why a separate payload

Decompression code linked into the helper crashed it: a build with static zlib died with SIGBUS
within minutes and once froze the console (`.ffpfsc` decompress, 7.0.22). So the decoding lives in
this short-lived ELF instead. The helper carries it as bytes (`payload/Makefile` embeds
`ps5upload-extractor.elf`), and for each extraction sends it to the console's own ELF loader on
`127.0.0.1:9021`, the way a PC sends a payload. It exits when the archive is done.

## How the helper and the extractor talk

Files in `/data/ps5upload/extract/` (see `src/xreq.h` and `payload/src/archive_extract.c`):

- `request.json` — written by the helper (mode 0600), read and **deleted** by the extractor at
  start (it can hold the archive's password);
- `status.json` — rewritten by the extractor (through a temporary file and a rename in the same
  folder) at most every 250 ms: state, files and bytes done/total, the current file, the counts,
  and on failure a cause token (`fs_extract_no_space: ...`, `fs_extract_wrong_password`, ...);
- `cancel` — created by the helper when Stop is asked; the extractor stops within one buffer. If
  it has not ended 10 s later the helper kills it and removes its temporary files;
- `job.rec` — the helper's note of a running extraction, so a helper that dies mid-way has the
  folder it made removed at its next start;
- `extractor.log` — the last run's stdout/stderr.

The process is named `ps5u-extract`: never `ps5upload-*`, which the helper SIGKILLs as a stray
instance of itself.

## Rules for what is written

`src/xsink.c`:

- names stay inside the destination: an absolute name, a drive letter, a `..` component, or a link
  already on the way (when merging into an existing folder) is refused and counted as `unsafe`;
- links, hard links, devices and other special entries are never created (counted as `links`);
- every file is written to `.ps5u-x-<pid>-<n>.part` in its own folder and renamed into place:
  the rename never crosses a mount (a cross-device rename panics the PS5 kernel);
- an existing file is kept (`skipped`) unless the request asks to replace it; a folder is never
  replaced by a file; a destination that exists is refused unless the request merges into it;
- free space: the unpacked total is checked before anything is written when the archive lists it
  (7z, zip, tar), each file's size before it is written, and a full drive while writing ends the
  extraction (`fs_extract_no_space`) with the partial file removed;
- 7-Zip runs single-threaded (`Z7_ST`) and every buffer is on the heap.

On a failure or a stop, the helper removes the destination when this run created it; when merging
into an existing folder, the files already written stay.

## Libraries

- 7-Zip 26.05, decoders only (`../third_party/7zip`, LGPL-2.1+): everything but RAR, including
  7z AES, zip AES and ZipCrypto passwords.
- libarchive 3.8.10, RAR readers only (`../third_party/libarchive`, BSD-2): RAR 1.5–4 and RAR5,
  single and multi-volume. 7-Zip's own RAR decoders come from UnRAR, whose license this GPL build
  cannot take (see `LICENSES/UnRAR-exception.md`). libarchive cannot decrypt RAR, so a
  password-protected RAR is refused with `fs_extract_rar_encrypted` and the apps say so.

## Building and testing

```console
make -C payload/extractor          # the PS5 ELF (payload/Makefile does this for the helper)
make -C payload/extractor host-test  # host build + tests/run.py (python3; 7zz or 7z for the 7z cases)
```

`tests/run.py` covers name traversal, links (in the archive and already in the destination),
multi-volume sets (7z, RAR4, RAR5) and a missing volume, passwords (7z with and without header
encryption, zip AES, ZipCrypto, a non-ASCII password), encrypted RAR, truncated and damaged
archives, out of space before and while writing, conflicts and Stop.
