/* ps5upload-extractor: one archive extraction, shared by the 7-Zip and the RAR back ends.
 *
 * The extractor is its own short-lived payload (never the helper: decompression code linked into the
 * helper crashed it, see payload/extractor/README.md). The helper writes a request, starts this ELF
 * through the console's loader, follows a status file and asks for a stop with a cancel file.
 *
 * Every byte the archive asks to write goes through the sink below (xsink.c), which owns the rules:
 *   - names are relative and stay inside the destination: an absolute name, a `..` component, a drive
 *     letter or an existing symbolic link on the way is refused (counted as `unsafe`, never written);
 *   - links and special files inside the archive are not created (counted as `links`);
 *   - a file is written to a temporary name in its own folder and renamed into place, so the rename
 *     never crosses a mount (a cross-device rename panics the PS5 kernel);
 *   - an existing file is kept (`skipped`) unless the request asked to replace it;
 *   - free space is checked before writing (the archive's total when it is known, each file anyway);
 *   - a stop asked through the cancel file ends the extraction within one buffer.
 *
 * Plain C, no PS5 types: the host test build runs the same code against temporary folders. */
