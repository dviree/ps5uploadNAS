/* The extractor's two files: the request the helper writes and the status the extractor writes back.
 *
 * Request (written by the helper with mode 0600, deleted by the extractor once read):
 *   {"id":"<hex>","archive":"/abs/first-volume","dest":"/abs/folder","password":"...","merge":false,"replace":false}
 * Status (rewritten through a temporary file and a rename in the same folder):
 *   {"id","pid","state":"running|done|failed","files_done","files_total","bytes_done","bytes_total",
 *    "files","dirs","bytes","skipped","unsafe","links","created_dest","current","message"}
 * `message` is empty or the cause token of a failure (fs_extract_...). The helper's side is
 * payload/src/archive_extract.c. */
